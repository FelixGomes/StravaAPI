1) Get authorization code from authorization page. This is a one time, manual step. 
Paste the below code in a browser, hit enter. Then grab the "code" part from the resulting url. 

https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=your_client_id&redirect_uri=http://localhost&response_type=code&scope=activity:read_all

2) Exchange authorization code for access token & refresh token
Paste the below code in a POST request at Postman

https://www.strava.com/oauth/token?client_id=insert_here&client_secret=insert_here
&code=insert_here&grant_type=authorization_code

3) View your activities using the access token just received
Run the code below in a GET request or browser

https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/activities?access_token=insert_here

4) Use refresh token to get new access tokens

https://www.strava.com/oauth/token?client_id=insert_here&client_secret=insert_here
&refresh_token=insert_here&grant_type=refresh_token

5) To get the detailed activity, you should have the id of the activity. 
This allows you to have access to information like calories, watts, etc.
